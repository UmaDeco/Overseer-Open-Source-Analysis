//! friendlyplugins — Overseer's NATIVE, in-process stand-ins for the popular companion plugins, so
//! you get their functionality WITHOUT loading their DLLs (or any third-party plugin host):
//!
//!   - **horseACT** — runtime race + trained-uma data dump in the Hakuraku-
//!     compatible format. Overseer does this natively: `race_export` (races — Career / Room match /
//!     Champions meeting / Practice room), `htt` (Team Trials results) and `umas` (veteran roster),
//!     all byte-compatible with horseACT v1.1.4. Works after the game updates that broke the plugin.
//!   - **CarrotBlender** — feeds the decrypted game responses to companion
//!     overlays (e.g. UmaOverlay-lite). Overseer does this natively in `uma_bridge` (UDP 17229, our own
//!     AES key/iv, driven by the update-proof DecompressResponse hook — no external plugin needed).
//!
//! This module is a thin coordinator: it owns the on/off for the CarrotBlender-style companion feed
//! and groups everything under one menu section. The heavy lifting stays in each feature's own
//! module (per-feature separation preserved). Server upload (horseACT's apiKey/serverUrl) is a
//! separate, protocol-specific follow-up — Overseer's local Hakuraku files already cover the exports.
